# ld-base

**ld-base** is an open-source back-end, written in the Go programming-language, with built-in support for **Linked Data** (including **JSON-LD**).

**ld-base** includes:

* a REST style API,
* an embedded (SQLite) database,
* SSE real-time streams & subscriptions, and
* a web-based administrative console (i.e., what some people mistakenly call a “dashboard”).

**ld-base** is useful for writing software for the Fediverse / Social Web, where you can just focus on building the front-end experience (and use "ld-base" as the back-end).
